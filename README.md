# head circumference embedded

A neural network was trained to measure fetal [head-circumference](https://github.com/DavidMagezi/head-circumference) on ultrasound images, using pytorch on a PC. This can then be deployed on an embedded system using a different C++ machine-learning library (for example, see [embedded example](https://github.com/DavidMagezi/embedded_example)).
